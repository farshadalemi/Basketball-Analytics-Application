This is a binary file, so I'll provide instructions on how to create it instead:

1. Create a simple 16:9 image with dimensions like 640x360 pixels
2. Add a play button icon in the center
3. Use a dark gradient background
4. Save it as "placeholder-video.jpg" in the frontend/public directory

Alternatively, you can use a free stock image or icon from a site like Unsplash or Pixabay.
