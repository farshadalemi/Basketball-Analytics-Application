# Database Migration Fix

This document explains the changes made to fix the database migration issue.

## Problem

The application was failing to start with the following error:

```
psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable: relation "videos" does not exist
```

This occurred because the migration script `add_video_processing_columns.py` was trying to add columns to the `videos` table, but the table didn't exist yet.

## Solution

1. Created a new migration script `create_base_tables.py` that creates the base tables (users and videos) before adding the video processing columns.
2. Updated the existing migration script `add_video_processing_columns.py` to depend on the new base tables migration.

## Migration Sequence

The migration sequence is now:

1. `create_base_tables.py` - Creates the users and videos tables
2. `add_video_processing_columns.py` - Adds video processing columns to the videos table

## Testing

You can test the migration fix by running:

```bash
chmod +x test_solution.sh
./test_solution.sh
```

This script will:
1. Reset the database
2. Run the migrations
3. Verify that all tables and columns exist

## Manual Testing

To manually test the migrations:

1. Reset your database
2. Run `python -m alembic upgrade head`
3. Run `python test_migrations.py` to verify the database structure

## Notes

- The `init_db.py` script can still be used as an alternative to migrations for development purposes.
- In production, always use migrations (`python -m alembic upgrade head`) to manage database schema changes.
