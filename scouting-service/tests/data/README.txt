Place a basketball game video file named 'sample_basketball.mp4' in this directory to test the video analysis functionality.

The video should be a basketball game recording in MP4 format. For best results, use a video with:
- Clear view of the court
- Visible players and ball
- Good lighting
- Minimal camera movement

If no sample video is provided, the system will generate a dummy video for testing purposes.
